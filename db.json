It was signed on July 25, 1984, and was the first land claim agreement ever settled in the Northwest Territories.</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>The Inuvialuit negotiated with the Canadian government for 10 years before reaching an agreement.</li>\n        <li>The Inuvialuit now own an area that covers about 90 600 square kilometres. Their ownership includes mineral rights, $152 million dollars, and the right to hunt on the land.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Next up is the <strong>Gwich&#x2019;in Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement</strong>, which was signed in April 1992.</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>The Gwich&#x2019;in are First Nations people who live in the Northwest Territories and Yukon.</li>\n        <li>The Gwich&#x2019;in received 22 422 square kilometres in the Northwest Territories and 1554 square kilometres in Yukon.</li>\n        <li>They also received more than $75 million and will receive other payments each year. As well, the Gwich&#x2019;in have begun negotiating for self-government.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <figure>\n        <a href=\"https://content-dev.edwin-nelson.com/lessons/Nel-UOS8-U05-L01/img/m05-p08-uos8.jpg\" data-lightbox=\"image27\" data-title=\"Every year, citizens of Inuvik celebrate the signing of the Inuvialuit Final Agreement with feasts and celebrations. | Photo Credit: &#xA9; Philippe Morin\">\n            <img src=\"https://content-dev.edwin-nelson.com/lessons/Nel-UOS8-U05-L01/img/m05-p08-uos8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"987\" height=\"674\"></a>\n        <figcaption>Every year, citizens of Inuvik celebrate the signing of the Inuvialuit Final Agreement with feasts and celebrations.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>The last agreement is the <strong>Nunavut Agreement</strong> of 1993.</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>It is Canada&#x2019;s largest Indigenous land claim settlement.

Many non&#x2013;First Nations people also don&#x2019;t want this development.</p>\n    <h3>Nova Scotia</h3>\n    <p>To settle disagreements over historic treaties, the Mi&#x2019;kmaq, Nova Scotia government, and Canadian government signed a Framework Agreement in 2002.
